    "Many software and harware platforms/ providers appeared to be impacted as the use of TPM is widely spreaded among those applications requiring a specific module for storing criptographic keys and performing encrypting and decrypting algorithms. Cloud computing platforms seemed to be specially affected by these two vulnerabilites as they may be used by malicious agents to try scaping the TPM and gaining acces to sensible data. The extension of the problem varied depending on the specific implementation of the TPM, and specially, on the information stored by the company in the positions that are accesible by this means.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<font size=\"3\"> The emergency created by this issue became exceptionally bigh as for the recent release of Microsoft's new operative system, Windows 11, requiring all systems using this distibution to have a Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 2.0 in which these two vulnerabilities were found, so there we were, with thousands and thousands of a wide variety of systems functioning under Windows 11, needing to make use of TPM 2.0 with a big security breach having a massive impact not only on particular users but also on the biggest technological companies in the world, compromising tons of critical information.   </font>\n",

    "Luckily, indiviudals could easily limit the extension of the hazard, limiting the physical access to their systems and using only signed applications had proven to be effective in order to mitigate as much as possible the effects of the breach. However, for enterprises there was no easy solution, as limiting the acces to their applications seemed to be no possible option, taking as an example cloud computing services, companies can not prevent users intentionally executing malicious commands to try to exploit the vulnerabilities, thus, in this scenario, companies rushed to published their own different patches that tackled the issue.\n",

    "<font size=\"3\">\n",
    "Therefore, as we can see, the only possible fix to these vulnerabilties is updating to a newer patched version of TPM which may be a valid solution for some systems, but depending on the device being used, updating it can be tricky or even so, not a possible solution, therefore the necessity to find other ways to mitigate this problem.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "<br><font size =\"3\">Additionally, we will be reviewing a BitLocker vulnerablity, asit is one of the most famous applications that makes use of TPM services, specifically we will see vulnerabilitie <a href=\"https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2024-20666\">CVE-2024-20666</a> relateds to an improper input validation, that is, the application is not correctly validating the data received, therefore, accepting incorrect inputs. In this case, the vulnerabilitie is only exploitable via physical access to the device given the functionality of Bitlocker. therefore, considerably reducing the risks attached to this security breach.</font>"

It mainly provides a root of trust, enhancing the security of computer systems by ensuring that the platform’s integrity is maintained from boot-up through application execution, that is, the system has not been modified nor manipulated, therefore securing the data contained in it, but how does a TPM detects these changes, and furthermore, how does it act when facing modification of a system?

This whole process is called <i>\"measured boot\"</i>.<br>\n",
    "This process works like this:&nbsp Each component in the boot sequence calculates a hash of the next component and extends this hash into a PCR. Extending a PCR involves concatenating the current value of the PCR with the new hash value, hashing this concatenated value, and then storing the result back in the PCR. Then, this hashed value is available for either the TPM to analise the integrity of the system and acting consequently, and for other applications to check that the system remains unmodified, providing like this a security check that grants the system is only accesed and modified by agents with proper permissions.</li>\n",
